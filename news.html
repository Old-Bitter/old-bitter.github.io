<h4>Week Eight - August 24th, 2025</h4>
            <p>It is the final week of the Summer 2025 semester, and I'm exhausted. I blame the 95+ degree weather. <em>Shakes fist at the sun</em>

            <p>I plan to purchase hosting services soon to further improve my web development skills without the static restrictions.</p>

            <p>This summer in my version control class, I learned to navigate GitHub, work cooperatively on web development projects, learned about new HTML and CSS practices, and learned how to manage merge conflicts.</p>

            <p>I'm still working on my final projects in SQL and JavaScript, and I will post more updates on my personal project website about them in the coming days.</p>

<h4>Week Six - August 11th, 2025</h4>
            <p>Created a pixel art flying bat divider and added a <a href="gtn.html">guess the number</a> JavaScript game I learned how to make in class a few weeks ago.</p>

            <p>It's midterm week and im super tired. <em>neeeed moooreee espresssssoooooo</em></p>

<h4>Week Six - August 9th, 2025</h4>
            <p>I haven't been updating this as often as I had initially planned. I've been super busy with class work. I've been working on our class website, learning JavaScript, and trying to master SQL. Unfortunately, I do not qualify for the Application Development Bachelor Program for Fall 2025 yet. I'm going to take a math, philosophy, and technical writing course to hopefully get in next time.</p>

            <p>It's 3:30 AM. <em>ZzZzZz</em></p>

            <p>Oh! I figured out how to get JavaScript Fetch requests to work on here!</p>

<h4>Week Three - July 28th, 2025</h4>
            <p>JavaScript loops == hard <em>cries in frustration</em></p>

<h4>Week Three - July 26th, 2025</h4>
            <p>Around 3 pm today, I lit a cinnamon-sugared pretzel scented candle and put on Black Sabbath (<em>RIP Ozzy</em>), then got to work.</p>

            <p>I picked up Issue #7 from our class website project for Abdul and me. I'm waiting for the about.html and students.html issues to be resolved to finish. I would also like the input from El and Shan on the CSS changes I made.</p>

            <p>On JustBitter.org, I added an image header and background and cleaned up index.html and style.css. I then did some research on whether I could do includes without PHP or JavaScript, and I couldn't. I then looked into adding a comment section, but it is nearly impossible without a database. I then went back to see if a third-party CMS would be a viable option, but it wasn't. I decided to use GitHub discussions until I learn more.</p>

            <p>I took a lot of L's today and I'm sleepy. Goodnight.</p>

<h4>Week One - July 11th, 2025</h4>
            <p>I guess I'll just make this a personal log of what I'm learning about. I'm taking <em>Using SQL & SQL Server</em>, <em>Intro to Software Development</em>, and <em>Intro to Programming</em> this summer. I'm hoping to use this to practice and display what I learn from those classes here.</p>
